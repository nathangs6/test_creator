An app that stores questions and generates practice tests.

After reading [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) I was inspired to make a project to assist in the spaced and interleaved practice of what I'm learning. In particular, it handles the larger pieces of information I want to review, which may be unwieldy on flashcards (though Anki is great). 

I also used this project as a way to get a small introduction to full-stack web development. Full-stack web development seems like a fun skill to have and I enjoy learning new progamming languages and software design principles, so I went ahead and did it :)

I will eventually implement a wipe of the database every week, so don't rely on it for permanent storage of your study materials. If you want your data to not be deleted, feel free to message me and we can discuss giving you permanent storage.
